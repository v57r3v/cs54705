GEOL 106 - ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HAZARDS 
Winter 2025
Course Description 
The relationship   between   human-kind and our ever-changing   planet,   with   a focus   on   natural   geologic hazards (volcanic eruptions, earthquakes,   landslides, tsunamis,   mass movement,   floods,   extraterrestrial impacts, etc.), and environmental   impacts which   result from   population   and   land-use   expansion   and   our   increased   use of water, energy and   mineral   resources. A   study   of the   sources   and   impact   of   pollution   and   global climate change.   Public   perception of and   response   to   geological   risk. 
Intended Student Learning Outcomes 
To complete this course, students will   demonstrate their   ability   to:
1.   identify and explain the causes   of   a variety   of   natural   hazards
2. evaluate the   impacts of   natural   hazards on   humans   and   human   infrastructure
3.   begin to formulate a   plan to mitigate risks   from   natural   hazards
4.   identify   Earth resources   used to support   human societies and   ways   they   are   exploited
5. critically discuss the ways   in which   human   activities   influence the   environment   and vice versa 
Course Materials 
A textbook   is   not required for this course.   Knowing that   some   learners   benefit from   having   a   textbook,   I   recommend ‘Introduction to Environmental Geology’ by   Edward   Keller.    Any edition   is   acceptable;   limited      numbers are available at the   Queen’s   bookstore.   If there   is   a   reading   that   I   think   will   benefit   you,   I   will provide   it. All other course material will   be   available   and   accessible via   OnQ.
Land Acknowledgment 
Let   us acknowledge that Queen’s   University   is situated on   traditional   Anishinaabe   and   Haudenosaunee territory. To acknowledge this traditional territory   is to recognize   its   longer   history,   one   predating   the establishment of the earliest   European colonies.   It   is   also to   acknowledge   this   territory’s   significance for   the   Indigenous   Peoples who   lived, and continue to   live,   upon   it and   whose   practices   and   spiritualties   are   tied   to      the   land and continue to develop   in   relationship to the   territory   and   its   other   inhabitants   today.   In   this course we will reflect on the   impacts that   the   way   we   live   and   interact   with   the   Earth   has   an   impact   on   the   land (geosphere, atmosphere,   hydrosphere,   biosphere), and   past,   present, and future   communities   and generations.
Equity, Diversity, and Inclusivity Statement 
Queen’s   University recognizes that the values of   equity   and   diversity   are vital   to   and   in   harmony   with   its educational mission and standards of   excellence.   It   acknowledges that   direct,   indirect,   and  代 写GEOL 106 - ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HAZARDS Winter 2025
代做程序编程语言 systemic discrimination exists within our institutional   structures,   policies,   and   practices   and   in   our   community. These take many forms and work to differentially   advantage   and   disadvantage   persons   across   social   identities   such   as race, ethnicity, disability, gender   identity,   sexual   orientation, faith,   and   socioeconomic   status,   among other examples.   In discussing topics covered   in this   class,   we   will   learn   about   how   these   identities   can increase a   person’s vulnerability to   natural   hazards.   I will work to   promote an   anti-discriminatory,   anti-racist,   and accountable environment where everyone feels welcome.      Every   member   of   this   class   is   asked   to   show      respect for every other   member. 
Building A Classroom Community 
University   is a   place to share, question,   and   challenge   ideas.   Each student   brings   a   different   lived   experience   from which to draw   upon. You    (and   I will   as well)   can   help   to   create   a   safer,   more   respectful   classroom community for   learners   by following these guidelines:
1.          Assume the   best of others and   expect the   best   of them.
2.         Acknowledge the   impact of oppression on   other   people’s   lives   and   make   sure your   words   and   tone   are respectful and   inclusive.
3.          Recognize and value   the   experiences,   abilities,   and   knowledge   each   person   brings   to   the   course.
4.          Pay close attention to   what   your   peers   say/write   before   you   respond.   Think   through   and   re-read   what you   have written   before you   post online or send   your   comments   to   others.
5.          It’s ok   to   disagree   with   ideas,   but   do   not   make   personal   attacks.
6.          Be open to   having your   ideas   challenged   and   challenge   others with   the   intent   of   facilitating   growth.
7.          Look for opportunities   to   agree   with   one   another,   building   on   and   intentionally   referencing   peers’    thoughts and   ideas; disagree without   making   personal attacks,   demeaning, or   embarrassing   others.
